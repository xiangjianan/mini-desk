## Selected blueprint: spatial-pan-stations

# spatial-pan-stations — Spatial Pan / Stations

**intent**: Pre-place a sequence of labeled stations on one oversized canvas, then traverse it with a single virtual camera — repeated lateral/diagonal pans that center each station in turn and reveal a callout at every stop, landing held on a final station.

**roles served**

- Hook (from hook-pan-timeline): a horizontal timeline of evenly-spaced milestones, left-panned beat by beat, each marker getting a spring-popped callout, landing on the present moment ("evolution / milestone walk leading up to us").
- Problem (from problem-camera-pan-stations): a connected web of pain "stations" linked by hand-drawn leading lines, diagonally panned station to station, ending on a tangled scribble knot ("too many disconnected steps — it's a mess").
- Product_Intro (from concept-demo-decode-pan): a two-shot strip bridged by ONE lateral pan — shot 1 holds a static phrase whose accent word 3D-flap-DECODES (the concept lands), then the camera pans across the strip (with background parallax) into shot 2, where a cursor drives a live typing demo. Pairs this pan with `cursor-ui-demo`'s focal-locked tracked typing.

**duration**: 7–10s (union of Hook 8–10s, Problem ~7s, concept-demo ~7s)

**shot structure**
One oversized flat canvas on a solid `[bg color]`; all stations/markers pre-placed in world space; `[accent color]` text + simple line-icons; one virtual `.world` camera pans ease-in-out between stops. Each station holds ~1.0s.

- Scene 1 (0.0–~1.0s): Camera opens on station 1 — `[label 1 / first step]` centered. A reveal lands on it (see variants). Camera then begins to PAN toward station 2, sliding station 1 out of frame.
- Scene 2 → Scene N-1 (~1.0s each): Camera PANS (ease-in-out) to center the next station; on arrival its `[label k]` (+ optional `[secondary label]`) is REVEALED with the role reveal. Repeat per station.
- Scene N (final, ~last beat): One last pan lands on the terminal station; the final `[callout / landing element]` reveals and HOLDS to the end. Camera goes static on the punchline.

- Variant — Hook: stations sit as evenly-spaced `[markers]` on a thin horizontal `[timeline]` (lower third); pans are LEFT-only along the single axis (timeline scrolls left). Each callout is a bordered `[callout box]` + downward triangle (offset drop-shadow) that SPRING-POPS up (scale 0→100%, bouncy overshoot, transform-origin at triangle tip) reading `[label k]`; a `[secondary label, e.g. year]` fades in and RISES above it. Some mid markers arrive as plain static text revealed by the pan alone (no box). Final scene lands on the `[present-day label]`, springs, holds.
- Variant — Problem: stations are scattered across a 2D web; pans are DIAGONAL, STEERED by `[accent color]` hand-drawn lines — each station has a rough write-on line/arrow that draws toward the next and the camera follows it (Scene 1 also draws a loop/circle around the headline's key word). Each station = a white `[line-icon]` above its `[label]`, revealed plainly by the pan (no spring box). Final scene: the accent line spirals into a dense chaotic SCRIBBLE KNOT centered on the field; camera holds static on the tangle (visual punchline).

**motion vocabulary**
repeated ease-in-out camera pans (horizontal-left for Hook, diagonal-steered for Problem) across one large static canvas; pre-placed stations sliding through frame via the pan; spring-overshoot callout pop with triangle-tip origin (Hook); rise-and-fade secondary label (Hook); plain labels/icons arriving via the pan alone; rough hand-drawn "write-on" leading lines/arrows + loop/circle key-word mark (Problem); terminal chaotic-scribble knot draw (Problem); static hold on the final station/punchline.

**rule mapping**

- camera pan / traverse across the canvas (primary) → `viewport-change` (single `.world` wrapper transform; PAN mode)
- sequencing the repeated pan beats into stops → `multi-phase-camera`
- centering each station as the pan target → `coordinate-target-zoom` (used as pan-to-target, no zoom)
- spring-overshoot callout pop, triangle-tip origin (Hook) → `spring-pop-entrance`
- rise-and-fade secondary label + plain per-station label/icon reveals via the pan → `discrete-text-sequence`
- hand-drawn leading lines / arrows / loop-circle key-word mark / terminal scribble knot (Problem) → `svg-path-draw`
- station line-icons (Problem) → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- static hold on the final station / punchline → (no motion; sustained held frame, no rule needed)

**camera modifier**: The pan IS the camera. One `.world` virtual-camera transform in PAN mode — `viewport-change` — sequenced across stops by `multi-phase-camera`, each stop targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` (pan-to-target). No depth push-in (that distinguishes this from the cluster-push-in / dataviz-pushthrough blueprints).

# Coordinate Target Zoom

A simple `scale > 1` on a wrapper pushes off-center content OFF the visible canvas. To zoom _into_ a specific non-centered element, apply scale AND an inverse translation in lockstep so the target lands at viewport center.

## How It Works

Two nested wrappers, separated concerns — never scale and translate on the SAME element (`translate * scale` ≠ `scale * translate` in CSS transform composition):

1. **Outer wrapper** applies `scale` (the zoom) around `transform-origin: 50% 50%`
2. **Inner wrapper** applies `translate(x, y)` (the counter-shift)

The counter-translate is the **negation** of the target's offset from viewport center:

```
T = -offset
```

Derivation: the inner translate moves the target to `offset + T` in pre-scale units; the outer scale S (around center) maps that to `S × (offset + T)`; landing at center means `S × (offset + T) = 0` → **`T = -offset`**. The formula does NOT depend on S — the translate is identical at 1.5×, 2×, or 3×. A common wrong intuition is `T = -offset × (S - 1)`: it coincidentally matches at S = 2 and is wrong at every other scale.

⚠️ **This is the NESTED-wrapper formula.** The single-wrapper camera in [viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md) puts `translate(x,y) scale(S)` on ONE element, where CSS applies scale first — there the counter-translate is **`T = -offset × S`**. The two formulas are not interchangeable; match the formula to the wrapper structure.

## Getting the offset

`T = -offset` is only as good as `offset`. The #1 way this pattern ships broken is hand-computing `offset` from a layout formula, getting the **sign** or magnitude wrong, and letting the zoom amplify a small error off-screen. **Default to measuring the target's real laid-out center; reserve the formula for symmetric rows.**

**Default — measure the actual center (works for ANY layout).** Immune to sign errors because it reads the rendered DOM, not a mental model:

```js
await document.fonts.ready; // metrics final; fallback fonts are 10–30px off → tens of px after a 3×+ zoom
const W = 1920,
  H = 1080;
const r = document.getElementById("target-card").getBoundingClientRect();
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = r.left + r.width / 2 - W / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_Y = r.top + r.height / 2 - H / 2;
```

Measure **once at setup** and bake — never per-frame in `onUpdate`. Because the measurement is async (`fonts.ready`), build and register the timeline inside the same `async` setup so the baked offset is ready before `window.__timelines[id]` is published.

**Shortcut — symmetric equal-width row ONLY:**

```js
const index_offset = targetIndex - (N - 1) / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = index_offset * (CARD_WIDTH + CARD_GAP);
```

⚠️ This assumes every sibling is the **same width**. The moment the row is asymmetric, it gives the wrong answer — often the wrong **sign**: the heavier side shifts the centered target the _opposite_ way you'd guess (e.g. `companion(220) + gap + wordmark + gap + chip(110)` puts the wordmark ~55px **right** of center, but "chip − companion" intuition says left). For anything but equal cards, **measure**.

**Headroom budget — cap the scale from the measured size.** A zoom multiplies any centering error; keep the target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak:

```js
const maxScale = Math.min((0.88 * W) / r.width, (0.88 * H) / r.height);
const ZOOM_SCALE = Math.min(DESIRED_SCALE, maxScale);
```

A target filling 97%+ of the frame reads as cut-off the instant its center is slightly off — and a hand-baked offset always is. (The perception gate flags this as `primary-offscreen`; `data-layout-allow-overflow` does **not** exempt it.)

## Recipe

```html
<div class="zoom-outer" id="zoom-outer">
  <div class="zoom-inner" id="zoom-inner">
    <div class="content">
      <div class="card">{other}</div>
      <div class="card target" id="target-card">{target}</div>
      <div class="card">{other}</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — at zoom > 1 the scaled content leaks past the frame */
}
.zoom-outer {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* center scaling is what the counter-translate math assumes */
  will-change: transform;
}
.zoom-inner {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
// TARGET_OFFSET_X/Y and ZOOM_SCALE come from "Getting the offset" — measured
// at setup (after fonts.ready), baked. Counter-translation = -offset.
const counterX = -TARGET_OFFSET_X;
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y;

// Scale and counter-translate MUST share position, duration, AND ease —
// otherwise the target visibly wanders mid-zoom.
tl.to("#zoom-outer", { scale: ZOOM_SCALE, duration: ZOOM_DUR, ease: "power3.inOut" }, ZOOM_AT);
tl.to(
  "#zoom-inner",
  { x: counterX, y: counterY, duration: ZOOM_DUR, ease: "power3.inOut" },
  ZOOM_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Zoom out (target → wide view)**: reverse the phases — start zoomed-in, then tween to `scale: 1` + `x: 0, y: 0`; the "reveal" beat is the panorama.
- **Multi-target zoom sequence**: chain zooms (target A → pause → target B → pull back); each segment needs its own counter-translation pair.

| ZOOM_AT    | after the layout lands + 0.5–1.5s       | give the viewer time to scan the layout before the camera commits                          |
| DWELL      | ≥ 1.0s after the zoom settles           | 1.5–2s ideal — the viewer must be able to read the target (climax dwell)                   |

## Critical Constraints

- **Outer scales, inner translates** — never both transforms on one element; nested wrappers keep the math clean.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on the outer wrapper** — non-center origin breaks the counter-translate derivation.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the scene root** — zoomed content leaks past the frame otherwise.
- **Scale and counter-translate share duration + ease** at the same timeline position, or the target drifts mid-zoom.
- **Offset measured once at setup** (after `fonts.ready`), baked — never recomputed per-frame, never hand-derived for a non-symmetric layout (wrong sign → target shoved off-frame).
- **Scale within the headroom budget** — target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak, derived from the measured size.

# Depth-of-Field Blur (Selective Focus / Rack Focus)

Pulls the eye to one focal element by **blurring** (and slightly **dimming**) everything around it while the focal layer stays sharp — the camera's depth-of-field falling off the background, or a rack-focus shifting which plane is in focus. `filter` and `opacity` are paint-only, so both tween seek-safe. This is the backing rule for the focus-falloff beat the blueprints reach for: outer nodes blurring during a push-in (`constellation-hub`), rack-focus across a parallax card stack (`cursor-ui-demo`), non-highlighted cards dimming to spotlight a hero metric (`dataviz-countup`).

## How It Works

Every layer carries a `--dof` custom property (px of blur), read by `filter: blur(var(--dof))`, plus its own `opacity`. A GSAP tween advances each layer's `--dof` from `0` to its target blur and its opacity from `1` to a dim level over the focus-shift window. The focal layer's `--dof` stays `0`. Per-layer targets derive from `data-depth` / index, so the falloff is identical on every seek.

Three mechanics, same primitive:

1. **Focal pull** — one window: off-focus layers go sharp(0) → blurred while the focal layer holds at 0. The eye is pulled to the only thing still crisp.
2. **Rack focus** — two adjacent windows on the same property: plane A's blur ramps 0 → max at the same position plane B's ramps max → 0. State continuity matters exactly as in `press-release-spring`: A's resting blur after the rack must equal what B held before it — author both as tweens on the same `--dof` at the same position so the hand-off is seamless.
3. **Blur-the-cluster-while-pushing-in** — the DoF tween runs at the SAME timeline position as a camera push-in (`multi-phase-camera` / `coordinate-target-zoom`): "the world recedes" and "we push in" read as one move.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="world" id="world">
  <!-- Focal layer — stays sharp -->
  <div class="layer focal" id="focal">{FocalLabel}</div>
  <!-- Off-focus layers — blur + dim; data-depth orders near→far -->
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="1">{Context A}</div>
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="2">{Context B}</div>
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="3">{Context C}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.world {
  /* single wrapper so a concurrent camera push-in transforms everything
     together; DoF is independent of the camera */
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%;
}
.layer {
  --dof: 0px; /* px of blur; filter reads it — starts sharp */
  filter: blur(var(--dof));
  will-change: filter; /* promotes the layer so per-frame re-rasterization is cheap */
}
.focal {
  z-index: 2; /* sharp layer must sit ABOVE the blurred ones, or its crisp
     edges read as bleeding into the haze */
}
.ctx {
  z-index: 1;
}
```

```js
// Mechanic 1 — FOCAL PULL. Blur scales with data-depth so far planes blur
// more than near ones; the focal layer (--dof: 0, opacity: 1) is untouched.
gsap.utils.toArray(".ctx").forEach((el) => {
  const depth = Number(el.dataset.depth) || 1;
  tl.to(
    el,
    {
      "--dof": `${BLUR_PER_DEPTH * depth}px`,
      opacity: DIM_LEVEL, // dim, not gone
      duration: FOCUS_DUR,
      ease: "power2.inOut",
    },
    FOCUS_START,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Rack focus between two depth planes** — `gsap.set` plane B pre-blurred BEFORE the rack (no pop), then two tweens sharing `RACK_START` + `RACK_DUR`: A → `MAX_BLUR` + `DIM_LEVEL`, B → `0px` + `1`. Shared window makes them cross at the midpoint.
- **Blur the cluster while pushing in** — run the focal-pull tweens at the same position + duration as a camera tween on `#world` (`scale/x/y`, `power2.inOut`). Camera transforms the world; DoF tweens the layers — independent property channels, no conflict.
- **Spotlight a hero metric in a card grid** — `gsap.utils.toArray(".card:not(.hero)")` all defocus (`GRID_BLUR` + `DIM_LEVEL`) on one shared window; heroes are skipped.
- **Refocus / settle** — if the beat resolves back to "everything visible" (or hands off to a crossfade needing a clean outgoing frame), ramp all `--dof` back to `0px` / opacity 1 over the tail (`REFOCUS_START + REFOCUS_DUR ≤ DURATION`).
- **Bounded focus-breathing on the focal layer (optional)** — a finite `ease:"none"` driver writes `Math.max(0, Math.sin(p)) * FOCAL_BREATH_PX` into the focal `--dof` during a hold. Keep it ≤ ~0.6px or it reads as "still focusing"; default to omitting it.

| FOCAL vs CTX sizing   | context smaller / grouped              | small context layers let a modest radius still read as "out of focus" — and blur cheaply                 |

Tokens: dark `{bgGradient}` so the sharp focal layer reads as lit and forward; heavy display `{font}` weight — blurred copy needs it to stay shape-legible.

## Critical Constraints

- **Tween the `--dof` variable on the timeline** — reading `filter: blur(var(--dof))` keeps the blur on the HF seek clock.
- **Blur the SMALL / GROUPED layers, not the giant one.** Filter cost scales with radius × pixel area; a 20 px blur on a full-frame background is the worst case. Keep per-layer radius ≤ ~24 px on large surfaces and lean on the `opacity` **dim** to do the push-back work — dim + modest blur reads more like real DoF than blur cranked to the max.
- **`will-change: filter`** on every layer whose blur animates (drop it after settle if the layer also does heavy transform work).
- **Focal layer stays genuinely sharp** — `--dof: 0`, untouched (or breathing ≤ 0.6 px). Any visible blur on the focal element kills the "this is the thing" read.
- **State continuity on a rack** — the outgoing plane starts at the blur the incoming plane was holding, and vice-versa; adjacent tweens on the same `--dof` at the same position.
- **DoF is independent of the camera** — blur the layers, transform `.world` for the push-in; don't fake DoF with the camera transform or vice-versa.
- **Settle sharp before a hand-off** — refocus to `--dof: 0` in the tail if the next beat is a crossfade/push; handing off mid-defocus reads as "the render glitched."
- **Sharp focal layer above blurred layers** (`z-index`).

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

# Multi-Phase Camera

A camera wrapper around the ENTIRE scene that progresses through discrete zoom phases at scripted triggers, with continuous sine-driven micro-drift overlaid so the camera never feels static between phases. Distinct from a single linear zoom — multi-phase creates cinematic pacing (anticipation → reveal → settle).

## How It Works

The camera is one wrapping `<div>` whose `transform: scale() translate(x, y)` is composed from two channels inside a single `onUpdate` writer:

1. **Phase scale** — a proxy object `{ scale }` stepped through phases at trigger times (`PHASE_1_SCALE` at t=0 → `PHASE_2_SCALE` at `PHASE_2_AT` → `PHASE_3_SCALE` at `PHASE_3_AT`).
2. **Drift offset** — a continuous sine-based `translateX` / `translateY` (small amplitude, slow frequency) ADDED to the phase transform. X and Y run at slightly different frequencies (`DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO ≈ 1.3`) — equal frequencies produce a perfect diagonal that reads mechanical; ~1.3 gives an organic Lissajous.

```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — any phase scale < 1 exposes the content's edges */
  background: {sceneBgColor}; /* background on .scene, NOT .camera — a camera-borne

}
```

```js
const camera = document.getElementById("camera");

// Three-phase scale plan: pullback → focus → push.
const phase = { scale: PHASE_1_SCALE }; // Phase 1 is the initial value — no tween

// Phase 2 — settle to neutral focus
tl.to(phase, { scale: PHASE_2_SCALE, duration: PHASE_2_DUR, ease: PHASE_2_EASE }, PHASE_2_AT);

// Phase 3 — slow push-in for the climax
tl.to(phase, { scale: PHASE_3_SCALE, duration: PHASE_3_DUR, ease: PHASE_3_EASE }, PHASE_3_AT);

// Drift driver — continuous sine motion overlaid on the phase scale.
// The ONE writer of camera.style.transform.
const drift = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  drift,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * DRIFT_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION, // spans the whole composition
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const dx = Math.sin(drift.p) * DRIFT_AMP_X;
      const dy = Math.sin(drift.p * DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO) * DRIFT_AMP_Y;
      camera.style.transform = `scale(${phase.scale}) translate(${dx}px, ${dy}px)`;
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Content reveals happen INSIDE the camera frame (hero/tagline/cta beats).
```

## Phase Patterns

| Pattern             | Scale sequence (1 → 2 → 3)        | Feel                            | When to use                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Focus-in**        | back → neutral → slight push      | Approach → settle → slight push | Default product reveal        |
| **Dramatic reveal** | push → neutral → pull             | Wide → focus → settle back      | Hero shot with breathing room |
| **Steady push**     | neutral → slight push → more push | Gradual forward momentum        | Continuous narrative push     |
| **Bookend pull**    | neutral → strong push → neutral   | Settle → push → release         | CTA emphasis then release     |

## Variations

- **Phase trigger by content beat**: align a camera tween's start with a content tween's end (entry completes → push begins) rather than a fixed clock value.
- **Camera shake (panic / impact)**: a brief higher-amplitude, higher-frequency drift tween over a short window — same `drift` mechanism with `SHAKE_AMP` / `SHAKE_CYCLES` / `SHAKE_DUR` at `SHAKE_AT`.
- **Targeted zoom into an off-center element**: combine scale with counter-translation so the target lands at viewport center — divide the measured offset by the current scale before feeding it into the writer:

```js
const tRect = document.querySelector(".cta").getBoundingClientRect();
const offsetX = (STAGE_W / 2 - (tRect.left + tRect.width / 2)) / phase.scale;
const offsetY = (STAGE_H / 2 - (tRect.top + tRect.height / 2)) / phase.scale;
// then in onUpdate: translate(offsetX + dx, offsetY + dy)
```

## Critical Constraints

- **Camera wraps EVERYTHING in the scene** — a per-element camera creates parallax bugs and breaks the "one viewpoint" read.
- **One writer**: phase scale and drift compose inside the single drift `onUpdate`; nothing else touches `camera.style.transform`.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`** — required whenever any phase scale < 1.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.camera`** — off-center origin creates unpredictable phase-to-phase drift.
- **Scene background on `.scene`, not `.camera`** — otherwise scaling/translating reveals the outer void.
- **Hero reveal starts AFTER the initial pull-back ease lands** — otherwise the headline feels like it's flying away.

# Viewport Change (Virtual Camera)

Simulates camera effects (zoom / pan / focus-lock on a moving element) by transforming a wrapper around ALL scene content. The "world" moves opposite to the perceived camera. Distinct from [multi-phase-camera](multi-phase-camera.md) (2-3 discrete phases + drift) — viewport-change is a single continuous zoom/pan, often used for focus-lock following a moving element.

## How It Works

Camera intent → world transform. Camera **pans right** → world `translateX(-distance)`; camera **zooms in** → world `scale(>1)`; camera **follows element X** → world `translateX(viewportCenter - elementWorldX)` per-frame. Get the sign right or everything moves the wrong way. The single `.world` wrapper holds the camera transform; elements inside are positioned in world space, unchanged.

**Single-element composite transform (this rule's form).** Both scale and translate live on ONE wrapper as `translate(x, y) scale(S)`. CSS applies scale FIRST, then translate (right-to-left matrix composition), so a point at world offset `(ox, oy)` lands on screen at `(S × ox + x, S × oy + y)`. To map the target to viewport center, solve `S × offset + T = 0`:

```
T = -offset × S
```

This is **different from [coordinate-target-zoom](coordinate-target-zoom.md)**, which uses two nested wrappers (outer scales, inner translates) and derives `T = -offset` (independent of S). Mixing up the two forms drifts the target off-center as scale changes. Use this single-wrapper form when you want one source of truth for camera state (`cam.scale`, `cam.x`, `cam.y`) written via `onUpdate`; use nested wrappers when scale and translate can tween independently with shared ease.

function applyCamera() {
  world.style.transform = `translate(${cam.x}px, ${cam.y}px) scale(${cam.scale})`;
}
applyCamera(); // seed frame 0

// Zoom in on the CTA: single-element composite transform → T = -offset × S.

## Scale Value Guide

| Effect      | Scale       | Feel                                |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Subtle      | 1.02 - 1.05 | Barely perceptible — "professional" |
| Medium      | 1.05 - 1.15 | "Ta-da" emphasis                    |
| Noticeable  | 1.15 - 1.30 | Focus on region                     |
| Dramatic    | 1.5 - 2.5   | Element fills screen                |
| Full-screen | 3.0+        | Element covers viewport             |

Perception: < 5% scale change is imperceptible; 10-15% is comfortable emphasis; > 30% is cinematic/dramatic. For a natural product feel, prefer 1.05-1.15× over 2-3s; save big > 1.3× zooms for dramatic narrative moments.

### Extreme range — 4–12× outward (workspace reveal)

The same single-cam math runs far past the table: a zoom-out workspace reveal opens punched-in at **4–12×** on one detail (a single cell, message, or button) and pulls out to the full workspace in one continuous move. The mechanics don't change — one `cam` object, `T = -offset × S`, one `applyCamera()` writer — only the authoring direction does:

- **Build the workspace at its final (1×) layout and OPEN scaled-in** (`cam.scale = 8`, counter-translate aiming the opening detail; state it in a `fromTo` / seed via `applyCamera()` so a seek to t=0 lands punched-in). The wide landing frame is then everything at native design size — text crisp, raster assets at source resolution.
- **Never the inverse** — authoring the close-up at 1× and scaling the world down to 0.08–0.25 for the wide frame drops every label below legible pixel size and softens raster media; the reveal lands on mush.
- **Measure the opening target** — at S = 8, a 1 px error in the baked offset is 8 px on screen at the opening pose. Take the offset from the target's real laid-out center (`getBoundingClientRect` after `fonts.ready`, once at setup — the measuring doctrine in [coordinate-target-zoom.md](coordinate-target-zoom.md)), never from a layout formula.
- **The opening detail must survive ×S** — it renders at `S ×` its design size on the first frames (vector/DOM text is safe; raster needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × S`).

## Variations

- **Focus-lock (camera follows a moving cursor/character)** — keep the element at a fixed screen X by computing the world offset per-frame inside the driver's `onUpdate`:

```js
const focusEl = document.querySelector(".moving-cursor");
const targetScreenX = VIEWPORT_WIDTH * FOCUS_SCREEN_X_FRAC; // 0.4–0.7; 0.5 = dead center
const focusUpdate = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  focusUpdate,
  {
    p: 1,
    duration: FOLLOW_DUR, // matches how long the focused element is in motion
    ease: "power2.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const rect = focusEl.getBoundingClientRect();
      cam.x = targetScreenX - (rect.left + rect.width / 2);
      applyCamera();
    },
  },
  FOLLOW_START,
);
```

- **Composite scale (multi-phase)** — two proxy tweens multiplied through one writer: `cam.scale = scaleUp.v * scaleDown.v; applyCamera()`. Combine a slow push-in (~1.15) with a brief release (~0.9) for a breath/punch shape.
- **Camera mode transition (centered → follow)** — crossfade two camera modes via a 0→1 weight tween; intermediate frames interpolate between the modes' offsets.

## Critical Constraints

- **One `.world` wrapper carries the whole camera** — every scene element lives inside it; a second transformed wrapper is a second camera.
- **Single source of truth via the `cam` object + `applyCamera()`** — when scale and translate both change, write them in ONE place; never split them across tweens that touch `world.style.transform` directly (the transform string composition order becomes unpredictable).
- **Single-wrapper counter-translate is `T = -offset × S`** — don't import the nested-wrapper `T = -offset` formula.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`**; **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.world`**; **background on `.scene`, never on `.world`**.
