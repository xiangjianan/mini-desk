## Selected blueprint: device-surface-showcase

# device-surface-showcase — Device / Surface Showcase

**intent**: A product surface — a device mockup or a floating browser/app window — is the hero held in frame while its screens cycle through a real flow, showcased by a camera move that ranges from a static hold to a continuous 3D push.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from key-feature-device-screen-tour, key-feature-floating-window-scroll, key-feature-3d-device-hand-demo): show a feature being \_experienced inside its real interface\* — the surface houses the action and its screens advance through a flow, rather than enumerating tiles or chasing a cursor across a workflow. (Note: the three founding drafts are Key_Feature and variants differ by MECHANIC, not role; the mined stepwise-flow variant widens the blueprint to Product_Intro.)
- Key_Feature (from demo-page-scroll-spotlight): the floating-window push-scroll variant carried to a spotlight climax — a real webpage rendered as a tilted 3D card coasts in (power2, like a phone held up — no spring), header keywords flare on a karaoke glow as the VO names them, the page rolls to the demoed section, and one element LIFTS off the surface (translateZ + scale) under a radial spotlight that dims the rest.
- Product_Intro (from stepwise-flow-completion): a compact end-to-end product flow — setup/auth → action → success/confirm — plays out cursorless as successive screen states inside the held surface, capped by a confirming button press; bookended by title-card beats. The surface introduces the product by \_completing its core loop\*, not by touring screens.
- Key_Feature (from `showcase-carousel`): the showcase-carousel — two surfaces in sequence (a widget card cycling brand skins, a phone frame with app screens sliding through it) gated by interstitial claim words; the screen cycle is a breadth carousel ("N brands / N apps"), not a flow.

**duration**: 5–11.3s (page-scroll-spotlight 5–9s · floating-window 7.8s · 3d-hand 7.9s · in-device approval 7.9s · stepwise-flow 8.5–9.4s · device-tour 9.6s · showcase-carousel 11.3s)

**shot structure** One product surface — a `[device mockup]` or a `[floating browser/app window]` — is the persistent hero on a `[styled backdrop: gradient / radial / stylized 3D void]`; its `[screens/sections]` cycle through a real `[product flow]` while a showcase camera (static-hold, push-in→zoom-out, or one continuous push) presents it. Each screen state holds ~1.0–1.5s.

- Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s): The surface ESTABLISHES — it `[slides in from an edge / drifts in from a tilt / dissolves from a full-frame title card]` and settles, with a `[accent shape or backdrop]` resolving behind it; the first `[screen]` is visible. The showcase camera begins (see variants).
- Scene 2 (~1.5–~Xs): The surface is OPERATED on its own face — a `[tap/select/scroll]` triggers the first screen advance: old content `[pushes out / scrolls up]`, new `[screen/section]` `[pulls up / pushes in from the side]`; concurrently a `[label / header word / side headline]` updates. The camera continues its move.
- Scene 3+ (~Xs–end, repeat for `[2–4 screen beats]`): The surface ADVANCES through successive `[screens/sections]`, each a discrete swap or scroll synced to the surface's flow, while the secondary copy `[swaps out-up / in-up]` or stays marked to hold reading position. HOLDS on the final `[screen]` (or, for one variant, blooms out — see variant).

- Variant — static-tour (key-feature-device-screen-tour, 9.6s): a `[device mockup]` slides in from off-screen and settles (ease-out); an `[accent-color shape]` scales up behind it (spring overshoot). Camera STAYS STATIC the entire clip — all motion is element/UI-level: a tap COMPRESSES a button (95%→100%), the UI scrolls/transitions to the next view (old pushes out, new pulls up), and a `[side headline]` SWAPS beside the device (old slides up + fades, new slides up + in) per screen. Holds on the final screen. No camera move, no cursor.
- Variant — floating-window (key-feature-floating-window-scroll, 7.8s): OPENS on a full-frame `[title card]` (a small `[icon]` draws in at center, `[feature name]` below; holds ~2s), which DISSOLVES to a `[macOS-style browser/app window]` floating on a `[vivid gradient]` (traffic-lights + `[URL pill]` + tabs; left nav, central content, right `[sidebar]`). Camera PUSHES IN on a `[target region/sidebar]` (active item highlighted `[accent]`, a cursor drifts down the list), then ZOOMS BACK OUT to re-frame the whole window while the content SCROLLS through `[sections]`; the `[highlighted item]` stays marked. One push-in→zoom-out arc, gated by the title-card opener.
- Variant — 3d-hand (key-feature-3d-device-hand-demo, 7.9s): FULLY 3D — a `[3D device]` drifts in a `[stylized 3D void / bloom + particles]`, opening tilted and self-rotating to face the lens nearly flat as ONE CONTINUOUS forward camera push begins (no cuts). A glossy `[3D hand]` rises from the bottom-foreground and GESTURE-DRIVES the surface: it swipes to scroll a `[picker/sidebar panel]` of `[option cards]` and taps `[option]` (while a `[header word]` letter-flips in place); the selection APPLIES — a `[new layout]` grows from center to fill the device face, nav flips, a `[marquee]` scrolls horizontally; the hand swipes again to scroll the page upward through `[sections]`, then drifts out. The camera never stops pushing; the bright device face keeps growing toward the lens until it BLOOMS into a `[light]` wash — a zoom-through "portal" exit that fills the frame.
- Variant — stepwise-flow (Product_Intro, 8.5–9.4s; in-device Key_Feature sub-mode 7.9s): CURSORLESS end-to-end flow — the surface completes `[setup/auth → action → success]` as a narrative arc. Opens on a `[title card]` that fades in/out on an ambient gradient (or a typed `[command]` running character-by-character on a terminal field). The `[flow surface]` arrives (phone mock slides up oversized and settles / bordered log panel replaces the command) and step 1 completes via rapid sequential pops — `[OTP digits]` fill boxes left-to-right capped by a green check, or `[log steps]` pop top-down with highlighted tokens, ending on a trailing-dots waiting state. State advances laterally (old content slides out left, new in from right, chrome persists) or via a dark-to-light scene swap into a white `[detail/confirm card]` whose elements stagger in. COMMIT: the `[CTA button]` is pressed (press dip / spinner "Processing") and a `[success state]` renders with check bullets — in the in-device sub-mode the commit runs a biometric ritual: dim overlay, `[squircle]` spring-pops, a ring draws around an icon, the icon morphs to a checkmark and holds; a slight camera push-in fires ONLY at the state transition (camera punctuates the commit, then re-locks). EXIT: the surface leaves and closing `[title cards]` pop in and ease smaller — the surface exits before the coda instead of holding. Camera otherwise static. For this variant the persistent hero is the FLOW, not one surface: a terminal panel may hand off wholesale to a confirm card.
- Variant — showcase-carousel (Key_Feature, 11.3s): TWO surfaces in sequence on a slowly drifting `[pastel mesh gradient]`, static camera, gated by centered interstitial `[claim words]` (fade in with gentle scale-up, fade out). Act 1: a white `[widget card]` scales in, flips/morphs into a tilted vertical widget and CYCLES `[N brand skins]` (~0.8s each) — one shared layout, per-skin content and accent swaps — while a large `[brand logo]` crossfades below per flip; the widget scales away. Act 2: a `[phone frame]` enters oversized and tilted, settles upright at center; full `[app screens]` slide left through it (~1s each), holding on the last. The screen cycle is a breadth carousel, not a flow — no taps, no cursor, no camera.

**motion vocabulary** surface establish (edge slide-in + settle / tilt drift-in + self-rotate-to-camera / title-card dissolve); accent shape spring behind surface; element-level screen-cycling (scroll-swap, push-in-from-side, scale-swap); button tap-compress; staggered side-headline reveal + copy swap (out-up / in-up); in-place header-word letter-flip; floating browser-window-on-gradient idle float; full-frame title-card opener (icon draw-in + label); camera push-IN on a region; camera zoom-OUT re-frame; content scroll-through; one continuous 3D camera-follow push (no cuts); 3D device drift + self-rotate; stylized-environment bloom/particles; 3D-hand entrance + swipe-scroll + tap (gesture-driven); picker-panel slide-in; template-apply grow-from-center; horizontal marquee scroll; gesture-driven page scroll; zoom-through bloom/portal exit; static-hold (no camera) as the floor of the camera range. Stepwise-flow additions: title-card bookends (fade-in/out opener; closers pop in then ease smaller); typed terminal command with prompt chevron; sequential top-down log pops with sub-line reveals; animated trailing-dots wait state; sequential digit pops left-to-right + green check confirm; lateral screen slide with persistent chrome; dark-to-light scene swap; staggered card element build-in (fade + slide-up); button press dip + fill flip; spinner processing state; success check-bullet reveal; notification banner spring-in with overshoot; lockscreen fade/blur-away as a card expands to fill the device face; commit-synced micro push-in; dim overlay; squircle spring pop; circular ring draw; icon morph to checkmark; surface exit before a title coda. Showcase-carousel additions: interstitial claim-word gate; brand-skin cycling with per-flip logo crossfade; card flip/morph into a tilted widget; oversized-tilted surface entry settling upright; fast slide-left screen carousel inside a static frame; drifting mesh-gradient backdrop.

**rule mapping** (per motion verb → backing rule, or flagged special)

- screen-cycling — UI scrolls/sections scroll inside the surface (device-tour, floating-window scroll, 3d-hand page scroll) → `3d-page-scroll` (webpage/app as a tilted card whose content `translateY`-scrolls to sections; primary mechanic for the surface's screen flow)
- floating-window establish + the surface presented as a tilted/floating UI card → `3d-page-scroll` (the tilt/perspective framing) + `css-3d-transforms` (perspective/`translateZ` depth)
- screen / side-copy state swaps (discrete screen states; side headline content swapping per beat) → `discrete-text-sequence`
- side-headline reveal (staggered fade + slide-up) → `discrete-text-sequence`
- in-place header-word letter-flip (3d-hand) → `hacker-flip-3d`
- screen swap as a coordinated shrink-out / pop-in between two screen states → `scale-swap-transition`
- template-apply "new layout grows from center to fill the face" (3d-hand) → `center-outward-expansion` (clustered-at-center → expand to fill)
- the surface morphing between states / title-card→window dissolve as the eye-anchor transition → `card-morph-anchor`
- button tap-compress (95%→100% press feedback) → `press-release-spring` (or `physics-press-reaction` for a heavier press)
- floating-window cursor click on the highlighted list item → `cursor-click-ripple`
- accent-highlight pop on the active sidebar/list item → `asr-keyword-glow` (accent glow on the focused item)
- drifting cursor down the sidebar list (floating-window) → `camera-cursor-tracking` (flat-cursor drift; pairs with the push-in)
- floating browser-window idle float / 3D device drift-breathe → `sine-wave-loop`
- 3D device drift + self-rotate-to-camera + perspective depth (3d-hand) → `css-3d-transforms` (CSS-3D) **or** `3d.md` technique (true Three.js/R3F device); see camera modifier
- horizontal `[marquee]` scroll (3d-hand) → `viewport-change` (PAN mode on the marquee strip) — _thin fit; a literal CSS-marquee/translateX loop is closer to a `gsap-effects`/CSS recipe than a named motion rule_
- 3D-hand entrance + swipe + tap as the interaction DRIVER (gesture input that scrolls/selects) → **flagged special — needs a heavier capability beyond the rule library (R3F/Three.js + WebGL), NOT a motion-shape rule.** The 3D hand model + WebGL bloom have a _technique_ backing (`3d.md` — R3F, `useGLTF` HandModel, `--gl=swiftshader` for the shader/bloom), but no motion-shape rule models a 3D hand as the swipe-to-scroll / tap-to-select gesture protocol. `context-sensitive-cursor` / `camera-cursor-tracking` only model a flat typing/pointer cursor, not a 3D gesturing hand.
- zoom-through bloom / portal exit (3d-hand) → **flagged special — needs a heavier capability beyond the rule library (WebGL), NOT a named transition rule.** Capability is `techniques.md` → WebGL shader (via `3d.md` headless WebGL: `--gl=swiftshader --concurrency=1`), but no named transition rule covers a bloom/portal fly-through.
- typed terminal command / non-linear log text (stepwise-flow) → `discrete-text-sequence` (typing + threshold state replacement) with `dynamic-content-sequencing` computing each step's window from content length
- sequential top-down log pops / OTP digit pops left-to-right / staggered confirm-card build-in → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group form; low overshoot for log lines)
- trailing-dots wait state → `sine-wave-loop` (finite repeats; step the opacity of 3 dots on a shared phase)
- lateral screen slide with persistent chrome → the existing screen-cycling mapping (`3d-page-scroll` translateX form inside the clipped surface); chrome sits outside the sliding layer
- notification banner spring-in / squircle pop (in-device) → `spring-pop-entrance`
- lockscreen fade/blur-away + card expands to fill the device face → `card-morph-anchor` (uniform-scale container morph — never tween width/height) + `depth-of-field-blur` (the blur-away)
- commit-synced micro push-in (camera punctuates the Approve/tap, then re-locks) → `multi-phase-camera` (single short push phase placed at the state transition)
- button press dip + fill flip / Approve press-down spring-back → `press-release-spring` (already mapped; the fill flip is its color-transition variation)
- spinner processing state → `svg-icon-enrichment` (rotating internal element with explicit SVG center)
- success check bullets / biometric ring draw → `svg-path-draw` (check strokes; ring rotated −90° to start at 12 o'clock) + `spring-pop-entrance` for the bullet pops
- icon morph to checkmark (biometric ritual) → **flagged special — SVG path morph, see hyperframes-keyframes (morph)**; no motion-shape rule models it — mechanics live in `techniques.md` / the keyframes skill, same tier as the blueprint's existing WebGL flags
- interstitial claim-word gate (fade + gentle scale-up, then out) → `gsap-effects` (plain fade/scale chord; deliberately quieter than `kinetic-beat-slam`)
- brand-skin cycling with per-flip logo crossfade → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-state content replacement at thresholds) + `scale-swap-transition` where a flip reads as shrink-out/pop-in; the card→tilted-widget flip/morph → `card-morph-anchor` + `css-3d-transforms`
- drifting mesh-gradient backdrop → `sine-wave-loop` (very-low-amplitude position/hue drift on gradient blobs)

**camera modifier**: The showcase camera spans a RANGE keyed by variant, all on a single content-wrapping virtual camera (`viewport-change`):

- static-tour → NO camera move (`viewport-change` held at scale 1, or omitted); all motion is element-level. This is the floor of the range and what distinguishes the device-tour from the rest.
- floating-window → a two-phase push-in → zoom-out arc → `multi-phase-camera` (e.g. dramatic-reveal 1.1→1.0→0.95 feel): push IN on the `[sidebar/region]` via `coordinate-target-zoom` (off-center target = scale + counter-translate), then `multi-phase-camera` zooms back OUT to re-frame the whole window while content scrolls.
- 3d-hand → ONE continuous forward push (no cuts) → `multi-phase-camera` in steady-push mode (1.0→1.03→1.06… plus its sine micro-drift) layered over `css-3d-transforms`/`3d.md` so the device self-rotates-to-lens during the push; the push runs unbroken into the bloom/portal exit (exit itself is the WebGL-shader flagged special above). Across all three: `viewport-change` is the base virtual-camera primitive; `multi-phase-camera` sequences the push/zoom phases (and supplies the always-on micro-drift that keeps even the "static" tour from feeling dead); `coordinate-target-zoom` aims the push at off-center screen detail.

**Overflow (pan/scroll surfaces — required for a clean `check`):** a panned or scrolled surface deliberately moves content PAST the edges of its framing card. Clip it at the card (`overflow: hidden` on the card/window) AND mark the moving inner layer (the `.world` / surface wrapper holding the screenshot + any markers/labels) with `data-layout-allow-overflow` — otherwise `check` reports `text_box_overflow` / `container_overflow` errors for the parts that scroll off (e.g. a marker label panned off the left edge). The card clips them visually; the attribute tells the layout audit it's intentional, not a layout bug.

# ASR Keyword Glow

Words in a phrase visually activate (glow blur + scale) when "spoken", following an attack-sustain-release envelope over per-word `{ start, end }` timestamps. In a real ASR pipeline the timings come from a word-level transcript (`hyperframes transcribe` — same shape); for promo video, hand-author them to control emphasis pacing. The envelope never falls to zero after a word — it decays to a rest level, leaving a breadcrumb of recent emphasis.

## How It Works

A single linear driver tween (`ease: "none"` — any other ease distorts the per-word envelope; do not change) sweeps scene time; its `onUpdate` loops over ALL words computing each one's envelope: 0 before `start`, linear attack to 1 over `ATTACK_DUR`, sustain at 1 until `end`, decay to `REST_LEVEL` over `RELEASE`, then hold at rest. The envelope drives `text-shadow` blur and `scale` — one driver for the whole phrase, never one tween per word (60+ words would bloat the timeline).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="phrase">
  <span class="word" data-word="{w1Key}">{w1}</span>
  <span class="word" data-word="{w2Key}">{w2}</span>
  <!-- … the final word may be the brand, with the .brand modifier -->
  <span class="word brand" data-word="{brandKey}">{brandWord}</span>
</div>
```

```css
.phrase {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: center;
  color: {restColor};
}
.word {
  display: inline-block; /* required for transform on <span> */
  transform-origin: 50% 50%;
  text-shadow: 0 0 0 {glowColorTransparent};
}
.word.brand {
  color: {brandAccentColor};
}
```

```js
// Per-word spoken windows — one entry per span; brand word 1.5-2× a normal word's window.
const TIMINGS = {
  // {w1Key}: { start: …, end: … },  — seconds, local to the scene
};

function envelope(time, start, end) {
  if (time < start) return 0;
  if (time < end) return Math.min((time - start) / ATTACK_DUR, 1);
  const releaseEnd = end + RELEASE;
  if (time < releaseEnd) return 1 - ((time - end) / RELEASE) * (1 - REST_LEVEL);
  return REST_LEVEL;
}

const words = document.querySelectorAll(".word");
const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: SCENE_DURATION,
    duration: SCENE_DURATION,
    ease: "none", // linear — t maps 1:1 to scene time
    onUpdate: () => {
      words.forEach((el) => {
        const timing = TIMINGS[el.dataset.word];
        if (!timing) return;
        const env = envelope(driver.t, timing.start, timing.end);
        el.style.textShadow = `0 0 ${MAX_BLUR * env}px ${glowColorRgba(env)}`;
        el.style.transform = `scale(${1 + MAX_SCALE_BOOST * env})`;
      });
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

`glowColorRgba(env)` returns the glow color with `env`-modulated alpha.

## Variations

- **Karaoke style (RECOMMENDED for video narration)** — the default amplitudes read too subtle in video: inactive words still dominate. Render inactive words DIM and lerp the active word toward bright + larger; at any moment 1–2 words are bright (spoken + lingering rest) and the rest is dim. Use for short phrases (5–10 words) where one word at a time should POP; keep the subtle default for long dense text. Pushes MAX_BLUR, MAX_SCALE_BOOST, and REST↔ACTIVE contrast; everything else identical:

```js
function lerpChannel(a, b, t) {
  return Math.round(a + (b - a) * t);
}
function colorAt(env, isBrand) {
  const target = isBrand ? BRAND_RGB : ACTIVE_RGB;
  return `rgb(${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.r, target.r, env)}, ${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.g, target.g, env)}, ${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.b, target.b, env)})`;
}
// in onUpdate: el.style.color = colorAt(env, el.classList.contains("brand"));
```

- **Multi-octave glow** — multiply the sustain by `1 + sin(driver.t × PULSE_HZ) × PULSE_AMPLITUDE` so high-emphasis words breathe at peak.
- **Color shift on the peak** — same channel-lerp from `restColor` → `peakColor` as `env` rises (non-karaoke form).
- **3D pop-out** — add `translateZ(env × MAX_POP_Z)` so the spoken word leans toward camera; requires `perspective` on the parent.
- **From real ASR transcripts** — convert `{ word, start_ms, end_ms }` entries to seconds and feed in identically.

## Values

| token           | default style        | karaoke style | notes                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ATTACK_DUR      | 0.1–0.25s            | same          | must be < the shortest word's window or it never reaches 1 |
| RELEASE         | 0.2–0.5s             | same          | decay to rest                                              |
| REST_LEVEL      | 0.15–0.4             | 0.05–0.2      | > 0 (breadcrumb), < 1                                      |
| MAX_BLUR        | 15–25px              | 30–45px       | bigger = "shouting"                                        |
| MAX_SCALE_BOOST | 0.03–0.10            | 0.15–0.25     | additive at peak (0.08 ⇒ scale 1.08)                       |
| PULSE_HZ / AMP  | 4–10 rad/s / 0.1–0.3 | —             | multi-octave variation                                     |
| MAX_POP_Z       | 20–60px              | —             | 3D variation                                               |
| SCENE_DURATION  | = `data-duration`    | same          | driver must end in sync with the scene's seek window       |

## Critical Constraints

- **Timings monotonic, non-overlapping** — every entry's `end` < the next entry's `start`; overlapping windows make the envelope ambiguous.
- **Brand word window 1.5–2× a normal word** — the brand is the headline; let it sustain.
- **Driver ease stays `"none"`** — any other ease warps every word's envelope timing.
- **`text-shadow`, not `box-shadow`** — the glow must hug the GLYPH (speaking emphasis), not the inline-block rectangle.
- **One driver looping all words** — never one tween per word.
- **Commit to a style** — values between the default and karaoke columns yield awkward "half-loud" emphasis.
- **Climax dwell ≥1s** after the final word's emphasis — the last word IS the headline beat.

## Selected motion rule: discrete-text-sequence

name: discrete-text-sequence
description: Replace entire text states at frame thresholds for non-linear typing effects — typos, bulk additions, pauses, backspaces, simulated thinking.
metadata:
  tags: text, typing, discrete, threshold, non-linear, sequence

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };

  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,

    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Values

| token               | range                                        | notes                                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE  | 48–96px                                      | full-bleed comps; smaller for terminal-style detail                    |
| TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH | ≥ widest state                               | measure with a hidden probe after `document.fonts.ready` if unsure     |
| milestone `t`s      | keystrokes 0.06–0.20s apart; pauses 0.3–0.6s | monotonically increasing; `T_DONE ≤ TOTAL_DURATION − ~1s` climax dwell |
| TYPE_DUR (smooth)   | `chars × 0.06–0.12s`                         | fast → relaxed                                                         |
| BLINK_CYCLES        | one cycle per 0.5–0.8s                       | `TOTAL_DURATION / 0.8 ≤ BLINK_CYCLES ≤ TOTAL_DURATION / 0.5`           |
| CURSOR_WIDTH        | ~0.3× font size                              | gap to text single-digit px so the cursor feels attached               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.
