## Selected blueprint: titlecard-reveal

# titlecard-reveal — Title-Card / Single-Card Reveal

**intent**: The calm breather/landing beat — one clean title or single brand/proof card revealed with exactly one restrained move (a slide-up crossfade, or a wipe-away-to-reveal), then a still hold. Low motion is the payload, not a deficiency.

**roles served**

- Benefits (from `benefits-titlecard-crossfade`, #34): a calm two-line value title card — headline value line, then one slide-up crossfade to a qualifier/elaboration line that holds center.
- Social_Proof (from `social-proof-reveal-card`, #35): wipe a busy app-collage open away with one diagonal pill-sweep to reveal a clean brand lockup (icon + wordmark) plus a centered "loved by [N]+ [audience] teams" social-proof line that spring-settles and holds.
- CTA (from `hard-cut-card-stack-to-logo`): a monochrome end-card
  CHAIN — statement → CTA / availability line → brand wordmark/logo — separated by instant hard
  cuts at full opacity; each card is its own allocated stillness, and the sequence terminates on
  the logo held to the final frame.
- Product_Intro (from `title-card-prelude-chain`): a three-beat dark title
  PRELUDE before any product UI — `[logo]` pop → `[name]` (a `[version]` appends grey→bright) →
  `[tagline]` card — chained by clears and blur-snap handoffs rather than hard cuts.

**duration**: 3–5s (Benefits 3–4s; Social_Proof ~5s / observed 4.7s). Card chains run 2–3s per
card, ~5.5–9.5s total.

**shot structure**

```
Scene 1 (0.0–~0.4s): static camera on [neutral / dark background]. Establish the opening state.
  Variant — Benefits: empty-to-text — [benefit line 1] is about to fade in centered (no busy open).
  Variant — Social_Proof: a busy intro frame holds briefly — an [app-screenshot / use-case collage] of overlapping cards under a [setup line].

Scene 2 (~0.4–~1.5s): the ONE move executes — a single restrained reveal that brings the calm card to center.
  Variant — Benefits: [benefit line 1] fades in centered while scaling slightly (~95%→100%, smooth ease-out) and holds.
  Variant — Social_Proof: a large [accent-color] rounded pill sweeps diagonally bottom-left → top-right and exits the corner, clip-path wiping the collage away to reveal the [brand logo lockup] beneath as the [logo icon] strokes draw on.

Scene 3 (~1.5s–end): the revealed/settled card holds to the end (the allocated stillness). At most one subtle live element (a slow breathing pulse on the card, or a very slow camera drift). No second development phase.
  Variant — Benefits: [benefit line 1] translates up and fades out as [benefit line 2 — qualifier / elaboration] translates up from below center and fades in to take center; holds. (This single slide-up crossfade IS the one move — Benefits front-loads no Scene-2 wipe.)
  Variant — Social_Proof: the lockup — [logo icon] centered, [wordmark] below, centered [social-proof tagline] "Loved by [N]+ [audience] teams" (the [N]+ may count up) — spring-settles small, then holds.

Variant — card chain (CTA end-card stack / Product_Intro title prelude): the single-card contract
repeats 2–3 times in sequence. Each card is a complete Scene 1–3 in miniature — arrive (or simply
BE there), at most one restrained move, hold — and the seams between cards are INSTANT hard cuts
at full opacity (no crossfade, no fade-through-black) or, in the prelude flavor, a blur-away →
snap-into-focus handoff.
  Card moves stay on budget: a character-by-character type-on with visible partial states, a
  right-to-left backspace that resolves the [wordmark] into the small [logo icon], a grey→bright
  append ("[name]" gains "[version]"), a blur-snap into focus — or nothing beyond a
  barely-perceptible continuous slow scale-up across the hold.
  The final card is always the [brand logo / lockup], held static to the last frame.
```

**motion vocabulary**: single restrained reveal (gentle fade-in + subtle scale-up settle | diagonal clip-path pill-wipe), one slide-up crossfade between two centered lines (Benefits), icon stroke draw-on (Social_Proof), optional "[N]+ teams" count-up, logo+tagline spring-settle-and-hold, subtle breathing on the held card, hold-to-end. Calm register — no spring chains, no tumble, no per-beat flips, no second phase. Camera static (optional very slow drift only). Card-chain register: instant hard cut at full opacity as the only seam, barely-perceptible
continuous slow scale-up across each hold, character-by-character type-on with visible partial
states, right-to-left backspace collapsing the wordmark into the logo icon, grey→bright text
append, blur-away → snap-into-focus card handoff, logo pop with overshoot + glow (prelude opener),
monochrome text-on-solid throughout.

**rule mapping**

- gentle fade-in + subtle scale-up settle (Benefits Scene 2) → `rules/scale-swap-transition.md` (restrained in/settle; cross-reference the fade ease in `techniques.md`)
- single slide-up crossfade between two centered lines (Benefits Scene 3) → `rules/discrete-text-sequence.md` (one line hands off to the next; translate-up + crossfade)
- diagonal pill-wipe reveal (Social_Proof Scene 2) → `rules/techniques.md` (clip-path reveal masks — the wipe)
- icon stroke draw-on (Social_Proof Scene 2) → `rules/svg-path-draw.md`
- "[N]+ teams" count-up (Social_Proof Scene 3, optional) → `rules/counting-dynamic-scale.md`
- logo + tagline spring-settle-and-hold (Social_Proof Scene 3) → `rules/spring-pop-entrance.md` (single soft settle; intentionally one beat, not a chain)
- subtle breathing on the held card (the one live element during the hold) → `rules/sine-wave-loop.md`
- type-on / backspace / grey→bright append (chain cards) → `rules/discrete-text-sequence.md`
  (non-linear typing incl. backspace; drive the version append as a bulk addition)
- wordmark remainder resolves into the logo icon → `rules/scale-swap-transition.md` (same-center
  swap fired as the last character deletes)
- barely-perceptible slow scale-up across a hold → the camera-modifier drift
  (`rules/multi-phase-camera.md`, micro-drift register) applied per-card
- blur-away → snap-into-focus handoff (prelude flavor) → `rules/depth-of-field-blur.md` (single
  pull on the outgoing / incoming card)
- logo pop with overshoot + glow (prelude card 1) → `rules/spring-pop-entrance.md` +
  `rules/ambient-glow-bloom.md`
- instant hard cut at full opacity → not a rule: a timeline `tl.set` swap — deliberately NO
  transition entry.

**camera modifier**: optional — a single very slow drift/push under the hold only → `rules/multi-phase-camera.md`. Default is fully static; do not add unless the held beat would otherwise read as a freeze-frame.

**stillness note**: This is a legitimate allocated-stillness beat. The hold in Scene 3 is the deliverable, not an unanimated gap — do NOT manufacture a development phase, extra swaps, or force-animation. One restrained move + a subtle hold (optionally one breathing element or one slow drift) is the correct and complete shape. The card-chain variant does not break this: each card individually obeys the one-move + hold
contract, and the hard cut is a seam, not a move. Boundary: if the cards flip at sub-second tempo
or each beat carries its own entrance/exit energy, you have left this blueprint — that is
`kinetic-type-beats` (its CTA variant owns the high-tempo value-line stack).

## Selected motion rule: scale-swap-transition

name: scale-swap-transition
description: Coordinated shrink-out + spring pop-in morph-like transition between two elements — no SVG path interpolation needed.
metadata:
  tags: transition, morph, scale, swap, spring, pop

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.

## Selected motion rule: svg-path-draw

description: Animate SVG paths drawing progressively using stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset.
metadata:

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |

| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
